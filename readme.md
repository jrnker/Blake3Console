# Blake3Console

## Overview
Super easy console application to hash files using the Blake3 algorithm.
Can be run from the command line or installed as a context menu item in Windows Explorer.

## Why?
Just to calculate Blake3's. That's it. ;)

..and I just needed that, to right-click on a file and calculate the hash.

## Usage
### Command Line

Calculate the hash of a file:
```shell
Blake3Console.exe <file>
```

Install context menu item in Windows Explorer:
```shell
Blake3Console.exe -i
```
Right-click on a file in Windows Explorer, select `Calculate Blake3 hash` and it will display the Blake3 hash.
